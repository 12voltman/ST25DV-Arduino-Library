# ST25DV-Arduino-Library
Arduino library for the ST25DV04K/16K/64K series of dynamic NFC tags with I2C interface
Ideally should be able to take a Wire instance for greater ease of use with boards that have multiple I2C ports.
Based on the datasheet available [here](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/group3/74/20/c5/ca/b8/a1/41/e3/DM00167716/files/DM00167716.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00167716.pdf)
